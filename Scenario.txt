Scenario-based: If an EC2 instance's root disk gets corrupted, how would you troubleshoot without losing data?

You would first stop the instance to prevent further data corruption.
Create a snapshot of the corrupted root disk to back up the data.
Launch a new EC2 instance and attach the backed-up snapshot as a new root volume.
Access the new instance to verify data integrity and perform any necessary repairs.
