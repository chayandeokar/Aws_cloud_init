Scenario-based: 
### 1. If an EC2 instance's root disk gets corrupted, how would you troubleshoot without losing data?

--> You would first stop the instance to prevent further data corruption.
--> Create a snapshot of the corrupted root disk to back up the data.
--> Launch a new EC2 instance and attach the backed-up snapshot as a new root volume.
--> Access the new instance to verify data integrity and perform any necessary repairs.

### 2. If you have downloaded the key but still can't login, how will you troubleshoot?

--> Ensure that the key file's permissions are set to be readable only by the owner.
--> Verify that you are using the correct username and hostname/IP when connecting to the instance.
--> Check the system logs on the instance for any SSH-related errors or issues.
--> Ensure that the instance's security group allows SSH traffic from your IP.

### 3. If you have five instances, each with a different hostname, and you want to create a single point of connection, which service would you use to route the traffic?

--> You can use a Load Balancer service, such as Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in AWS, to distribute incoming traffic among the instances. It provides high availability and evenly balances the load.
